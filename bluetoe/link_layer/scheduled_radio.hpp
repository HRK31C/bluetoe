     * The API provides a set of scheduling functions, which schedules transmit and/or receiving of the radion. All scheduling functions take a point in time
     * to switch on the receiver / transmitter and to transmit and to receive. This points are defined as relative offsets to a previous point in time T0. The
     * first T0 is defined by the return of the constructor. After that, every scheduling function have to define what the next T0 is, that the next
     * functions relative point in time, is based on.

         * function is based on the time, the tranmision was scheduled. So the new T0 = T0 + when.

         * This function is intended to be used for sending advertising PDUs. If the given receive buffer is empty, the timeout callback
